class Position(BaseModel):
    """A position is the expression of a market commitment, or exposure, held by a trader. When the position is closed,
    it becomes a trade, profit, loss or other metrics can then be calculated.

    A position is defined by its size (amount of coin) and direction ('LONG' or 'SHORT').
    - 'LONG' position means that you are buying an asset (or speculating that the asset will increase in value).
    - 'SHORT' position aims to make a profit when an assetâ€™s price decreases (not implemented yet).

    Attributes:
        strategy_name: the nickname of the strategy used to open the position
        coin: the coin that have been bought
        currency: the currency used to buy the coin
        amount: coin's amount that have been bought
        side: weather the position is a 'LONG' or a 'SHORT'

        open_date: the date when the position was open, usually the open_date of a candle
        open_price: coin's price when the position was open
        initial_investment: the initial amount of currency the trader invested
        open_fees: cost of opening the position, fees are being taken before calculating coin amount
        stop_loss: stop your loss if price drops too low (close the position)
        take_profit: take your profits if price reaches your target (close the position)

        close_date: the date when a position was closed, could be any time
        close_price: coin's price when the position was closed
        close_fees: fees from selling the position
